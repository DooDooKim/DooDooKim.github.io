  Hello, my name is Junho Kim, a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.
  I am researching in Image and Video Systems Lab., under the supervision of Professor Yong Man Ro.
  I have experiences with mainly deep learning and machine learning.
  Now I am more focusing on visual-text and visual-audio multi-modal learning.
